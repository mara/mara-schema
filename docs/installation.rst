Installation
============

To use the library directly, use pip:

``$ pip install mara-schema``

or
 
``$ pip install git+https://github.com/mara/mara-schema.git``

For an example of an integration into a flask application, have a look at the `Mara Example Project 1 <https://github.com/mara/mara-example-project-1>`_.
